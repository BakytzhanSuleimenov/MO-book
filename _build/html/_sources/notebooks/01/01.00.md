This notebook is part of the module Applied Optimization of the Analytics Academy's Data Science Essentials.

 > During this course we make use of Jupyter notebooks hosted by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 
  Notebooks deployed on `colab` require neither python nor other dependencies to be installed on your own machine, you only need a browser (preferably `chrome`) and you may also need a google account if you want to execute them.

This training consists of a series of self-contained stories. 

This whole series makes use of [pyomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyomo) which is the most complete and versatile Mathematical Optimization package in the python ecosystem.

The notebooks used in this course make extensive use of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) of which [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) you may find a very comprehensive summary. May you like a document that you can print, fold, and take with you then you may like to check [this](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

We also draw pictures on our notebooks. Therefore, we need the [magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) below. 


For this notebook we need the following packages:
 * sympy
 * math
 * matplotlib 
 * IPython
 * pyomo 
 * ipopt

If your python distribution is Anaconda, then from the above only the last two are likely not yet to be part of your local python installation.
You need to install those packages on the anaconda prompt. As usual, you should try first with `conda install` and if that does not work then with `pip install`.
You can try the conda distribution as explained in:
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyomo
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ipopt 
For pyomo please read http://www.pyomo.org/installation and doe ipopt please refer to https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/ 



## About being pythonic

If you program, then reading [this](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) will help you writing code that feels _natural_ in python. You may also like to uncomment the following statement for some introspection ðŸ˜‰
