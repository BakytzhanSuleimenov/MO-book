The problem constraints can then be implemented by summing the binary variables along the two axes. The arithmetic constraint becomes a more challenging.\n","\n","[Another approach](https://www.gecode.org/doc/6.0.1/MPG.pdf) is to use Pyomo integer variables indexed by letters, then setup an linear expression to represent the puzzle following the scheme\n","\n","                 1000 S + 100 E + 10 N + D\n","               + 1000 M + 100 O + 19 R + E\n","    == 10000 M + 1000 O + 100 N + 10 E + Y\n","\n","The requirement that no two letters be assigned the same digit could, in principle, be implemented with an inequality constraint.
