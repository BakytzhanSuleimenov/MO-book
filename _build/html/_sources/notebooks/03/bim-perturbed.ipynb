    "The company BIM realizes that a $1\\%$ fraction of the copper always gets wasted while producing both types of microchips, more specifically $1\\%$ of the required amount. This means that it actually takes $4.04$ gr of copper to produce a logic chip and $2.02$ gr of copper to produce a memory chip. If we rewrite the linear problem of [the basic BIM problem](../02/bim.ipynb) and modify accordingly the coefficients in the corresponding constraints, we obtain the following problem \n",

    "In terms of production, of course, we would simply produce entire chips but it is not clear how to implement the fractional solution $(x_1,x_2) \\approx (626.238,1123.762)$. Rounding down to $(x_1,x_2) = (626,1123)$ will intuitively yield a feasible solution, but we might be giving away some profit and/or not using efficiently the available material. Rounding up to $(x_1,x_2) = (627,1124)$ could possibly lead to an unfeasible solution for which the available material is not enough.
