# # Building Insulation

# The decision on much it invest in insulating a building is determined by a tradeoff between the capital costs of insulation and the annual operating costs for heating and air conditioning. This notebook shows the formulation and solution of an optimization problem using conic programming.
# 

# ## Bibliographic Notes
# 
# To the best of my knowledge, this problem is not well-known example in the mathematical optimization literature. There are a number of application papers with differing levels of detail.

# ## A Simple Model
# 
# Consider a wall or surface separating conditioned interior space in a building at temperature $T_i$ from the external environment at temperature $T_o$. Heat conduction through the wall is given by
# 
# $$\dot{Q} = UA (T_i - T_o)$$
# 
# where $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient. For a surface constructed from up to $M$ layers of different insulating materials, the inverse of the overall heat transfer coefficient is a determined by a sum of serial thermal "resistances"
# 
# $$\frac{1}{U} = R_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M R_m$$
# 
# where $R_0$ is thermal resistance of wall or surface structural elements building. The thermal resistances of each layer is given by $R_m = \frac{x_m}{k_m}$ such that
# 
# $$\frac{1}{U} = R_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{x_m}{k_m}$$
# 
# where each material layer is characterized by a thickness $x_m$ and a thermal conductivity $k_m$.
# 
# We assume the annual energy costs are proportional to thermal conductivity $U$. The cost of installing a unit area of unit area of insulation is given by an affine expression
# 
# $$a_m + b_m x_m$$
# 
# The combined annualized costs are
# 
# $$\alpha U + \beta\sum_{m=1}^m (a_m y_m + b_m x_m)$$
# 
# where $\beta$ is a discount factor for the equivalent annualized cost of a capital investment in insulation. Binary variable $y_m$ is a binary variable indicates whether or not layer $m$ is included in the installation. The feasible values for $x_m$ are subject to constraints
# 
# $$\begin{align}
# x_m & \leq Ty_m \\
# \sum_{m=1}^M x_m & \leq T
# \end{align}$$
# 
# where $T$ is an upper bound on wall thickness.

# ## Mixed Integer Optimization
# 
# 
# The economic objective is to minimize the combined annual energy operating expenses and capital cost of insulation. Let $\alpha$ be a coefficient for the proportional relationship of the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ to the annual energy costs.  
# 
# $$\min \alpha U + \beta \sum_{m=1}^M (a_my_m + b_mx_m) $$
# 
# subject to constraints
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# R & = R_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M\frac{x_m}{k_m} \\
# \sum_{m=1}^M x_m & \leq T \\
# x_m & \geq 0 \\
# y_m & \in \text{Binary} \\
# x_m & \leq Ty_m \\
# R U & \geq 1 \\
# R, U & > 0
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# where binary variables $y_m$ indicate whether layer $m$ is included in the insulation package, and $x_m$ is the thickness of layer $m$ if included.
