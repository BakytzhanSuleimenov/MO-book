    "# Kelly Criterion and Exponential Cones\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kelly Criterion for the size of optimal bets was originally proposed in 1956 by John Kelly at Bell Laboratories. He identified an analogy between gambling and encoding information for transmission on noisy channels, then finding that by choosing bet sizes appropriately, then\n",
    "\n",
    "> The maximum exponential rate of growth of he gambler's capital is equal to the rate of transmission of informration over the channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea actually pre-dates Kelly. In 1738, the famous mathematician Daniel Bernoulli offered a resolution to the St. Petersburg paradox (proposed by his cousin, Nicholas Bernoulli in 1711) by suggesting one should choose bets of investments with the highest geometric mean of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described by William Poundstone in the popular book \"Fortune's Formula\", following Kelly's paper, this idea this was quickly picked up by both gamblers and investors, with many colorful adventures by early adopters in both Las Vegas and Wall Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the analysis of Cajas (2021), this notebook presents a version of the the problem analysis demonstrating the applcation of exponential cone programming. "
