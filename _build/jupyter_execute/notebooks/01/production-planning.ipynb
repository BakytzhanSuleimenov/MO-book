    "Pyomo is an algebraic modeling language embedded within Python for creating mathematical optimization applications. Pyomo can create objects representing decision variables, expressions, objective functions, and constraints. Much of the utility of Pyomo comes from methods to transform and solve models with a choice of open-source and commercial solvers. \n",

A more complete version of the problem is revisited in Chapter 10 to demonstrate stochastic and robust optimization.

This is a relatively new feature available in recent versions of Pyomo.
