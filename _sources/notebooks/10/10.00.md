# 10. Two-Stage Problems

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of two-stage problems affected by uncertainty:

* [Airline seating splitting](airline-seating.ipynb)
* [Farmer land allocation](farmer.ipynb)
* [Two-stage production planning](ccg.ipynb), a multi-stage revisitation of the introductory problem from [Chapter 1](../01/01.00.md) solved both with SAA and CCG.
