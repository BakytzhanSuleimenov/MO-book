# Data-Driven Mathematical Optimization in Python

Welcome to this repository of companion notebooks for *Data-Driven Mathematical Optimization in Python*, a project currently under development with completion expected by Fall, 2022. These notebooks are intended to introduce the concepts and tools of mathematical optimization with examples from a range of disciplines. The goals of these notebooks are

* to provide a foundation in mathematical optimization,
* illustrate the tools and concepts of optimization with practical examples,
* show how to create and solve models using a state-of-the-art modeling language and solvers.

## Getting started

The notebooks in this repository use [Pyomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyomo) which is the most complete and versatile mathematical optimization package in the python ecosystem. Pyomo provides a means to create models for optimization using the natural concepts of decision variables, constraints, and objectives from mathematical optimization.

Most of the notebooks in this library can be opened and run in Google Colab. A launch icon appearing at the top of a page (look for the rocket) indicates the notebook can be opened as executable document. Selecting Colab will reopen in the notebook in Google Colab. Cells inside of the notebooks will perform any necessary installations of Pyomo and solvers needed to execute the code within the notebook.

## Help us!

We seek your feedback! If you encounter problems or have advice on how to make these examples better, please feel free to an open an issue using the link at the top of every page (look for the Github cat icon). 

## About Us

We are a group of researchers and educators who came together with a common purpose of developing materials for use in our own classroom teaching. Hopefully these materials will find use in other classrooms and by those seeking entry into the world of building optimization models for data-rich applications.
