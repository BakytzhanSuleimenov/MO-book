    "### Use `pyo.ConcreteModel`  instead of `pyo.AbstractModel`\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization applications required a close coupling of mathematics and problem data. Data sources are needed to determine values for the parameters appearing the mathematical description of the problem. For algebraic modeling languages like Pyomo, this raises a \"chicken or the egg\" dilemma: Which comes first, the algebraic model represented in the modeling language, or the data that specify values for the model parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo provides for both possibilities. A Pyomo `pyo.AbstractModel` object can be created before the data is known. Pyomo  includes methods to load parameter values after the data becomes available. This establishes a two phase procedure where the second phase employs Pyomo methods to access data and create a specific model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a Pyomo `pyo.ConcreteModel` object is created from known data. This results in single phase of model building where components are fully constructed and initialized when they are first attached to the `pyo.ConcreteModel` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we encourage the consistent use of `pyo.ConcreteModel` to build Pyomo models. The main reason is that Python offers  tools for wrangling data from a wide range of sources.  The tools range from standard Python data structures like tuples, lists, and dictionaries, to feature-rich packages such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [datatable](https://github.com/h2oai/datatable). These tools can used to construct and initialize parameters in a `ConcreteModel` as it is constructed. Using `pyo.ConcreteModel` removes the need to create and store intermediate forms of the algebraic model or, for that mater, to pre-process the model data for later use in an `AbstractModel`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ability to index components, such as variables and constraints, is essential to scaling a model for larger applications. In general, components attached to a Pyomo `ConcreteModel` can be indexed by ordered Python iterables such as lists, dictionary keys, tuples, and ordered sets. In principle, this enables a deep integration of Python data structures with Pyomo models.\n",

    "`pyo.Var()` accepts a keyword option `within` or `domain` to specify a class of decision variables. To reduce the cognitive burden for a new user or when reading Pyomo models, consistent use of `domain` is preferred because of its common use in mathematics to represent the set of all values for which a variable is defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Use decorators to improve readability\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed Pyomo constraints are constructed by a rule.  When constraints are specified with `pyo.Constraint()`, rules are normally named by adding `_rule` as a suffix to the name of the associated constraint. For example, assuming model `m`  and the associated sets, parameters, and variables have been previously defined, \n",

For Python users unfamiliar with decorators, decorators can be described as a way to 'tag' functions that are to be incorporated into the Pyomo model.
