    "Pyomo comprises an ecosystem of core modules, third party contributed modules, and many choices of both open-source and commercial solvers. This opens up many options for an experienced user, but can also be a challenging for someone getting started with Pyomo.  These notes are intended to help the reader get started by providing instructions for a basic installation of Pyomo with a core set of solvers. "

    "Linear and Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization (MILO) covers a wide range of applications. [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) is a [high-performance, open-source solver](https://mattmilten.github.io/mittelmann-plots/) for MILO applications sponsored by COIN-OR. It can be used with Pyomo through the [Auto-Persistant Pyomo Solver Interface (APPSI)](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library_reference/appsi/appsi.html). The HiGHS project provides a convenient `pip` installer that includes Pyomo and all necessary dependencies. \n",
