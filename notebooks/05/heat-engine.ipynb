    "Endoreversible thermodynamics is subfield of irreversible thermodynamics focusing on the fundamental analysis of energy conversion accounting for finite resistances to heat transfer. Classical thermodynamics studies the theoretical limit of engines without the heat transfer resistances that limit performance in real world applications. It has been found that the efficiency bounds developed in this manner are generally closer estimates of actual performance than the more familiar Carnot efficiency described in introductory textbooks. The example described here is generally attributed to Curzon and Ahlborn (1975).\n",
