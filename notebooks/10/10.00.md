# 10. Two-Stage Problems

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of two-stage problems affected by uncertainty:

* [Airline seating splitting](airline-seating.ipynb)
* [Farmer land allocation](farmer.ipynb)
* [Energy dispatch problem with wind curtailment](opf-wind-curtailment.ipynb), a two-stage revisitation of the problem from [Chapter 4](../04/04.00.md) with binary second-stage variables.
* [Optimal power flow problem with recourse actions](opf-ldr.ipynb), a two-stage revisitation of the problem from [Chapter 4](../04/04.00.md) that uses linear decision rules.
* [Two-stage production planning](ccg.ipynb), a multi-stage revisitation of the introductory problem from [Chapter 1](../01/01.00.md) solved both with SAA and CCG.
