# 9. Stochastic Optimization - Single Stage Problems

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of stochastic optimization:

* [Optimal management of a pop-up shop](01-pop-up-shop.ipynb)
* [Markowitz portfolio with chance constraints](02-markowitz-portfolio-with-chance-constraint.ipynb)
* [Stock optimization for seafood distribution center](03-seafood-distribution-center.ipynb)
* [Economic dispatch in energy systems](04-economic-dispatch.ipynb)

Go to the [next chapter](../10/10.00.md) about two-stage (robust and stochastic) optimization.
