# 1. Mathematical Optimization

## Getting started

These notebooks used in the repository make use of [pyomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyomo) which is the most complete and versatile Mathematical Optimization package in the python ecosystem. Pyomo provides the means to create models for optimization using the natural concepts of decision variables, constraints, and objectives from mathematical optimization.

Pyomo transforms optimization models into objects that can be solved by specialized optimization software. There are many solvers available for use with Pyomo, including open source libraries such as glpk, cbc, and ipopt, as well as high-performance commercial libraries including CPLEX, Gurobi, and Mosek. The flexibility to apply different transformations and choose solvers suited to a particular application is one of the most important features of Pyomo.

Most of the notebooks in this library can be opened and run in Google Colab. A launch icon appearing at the top of a page (look for a little rocket shape) indicates the notebook can be opened as executable document. Selecting Colab will reopen in the notebook in Google Colab. Cells inside of the notebooks will perform any necessary installations of Pyomo and solvers needed to execute the code within the notebook.

## Help us!

We seek your feedback! If you encounter problems, or have advice on how to make these examples better, please feel free to an open an issue using the link at the top of every page (look for the Github cat icon). 

## Next steps

Users may wish to download notebooks to their own computers and laptops. More information will be forthcoming with recommendations on how to configure your computer for use with these notebooks. In the meanwhile, refer to the [ND Pyomo Cookbook](https://jckantor.github.io/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/) for advice on installation of Pyomo and solvers.
